      When people think of thoughtfulness, you immediately come to mind. You always put other people before yourself, give the most thoughtful gifts, and the most sincere advice and conversations. But because you show so much thoughtfulness and love to the people around you, you can get jealous when you see things getting reciprocated to other people and not to yourself.
