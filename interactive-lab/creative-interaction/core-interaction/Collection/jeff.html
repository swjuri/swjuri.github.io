<p>Tokyo design studio Spread used industrial materials to create this minimal CD packaging design for Japanese band Soutaiseiriron and American producer Jeff Mills' track Spectrum.

The light weight and lack of a CD jacket were intended "to convey deep consideration for the musicians' work and the presence of the object itself." Read more about Spectrum CD packaging »
<p>Created for Soutaiseiriron and American producer Jeff Mills' track Spectrum, the casing is made from a solid square slab of metal with the CD housed in a cut-out circular section."In a download-centric era, we were able to give new meaning to the CD as an object though its packaging," said Spread's Hirokazu Kobayashi, who founded the studio in 2004.</p>
<p>The packaging is wrapped in a plastic bubblewrap envelope, which is labelled with a yellow and black sticker – designed to mimic the "caution" warnings often found on industrial products. When the copper-coloured CD is removed, it reveals abstract black and grey illustration by Etsuko Yakushimaru.During design meetings, the musicians discussed Sangaku – a traditional Japanese mathematical puzzle – and this also inspired the studio's design work.

"It seeks to express the concepts of art, industrial, experimentation, and minimalism," said Spread. "The solution was these metal objects, each one cut carefully and individually by Tsubame-sanjo area in Japan, which boasts the best metal processing technology in the world.""The total weight of 0.5 kilograms and the lack of a CD jacket are an attempt to convey deep consideration for the musicians' work and the presence of the object itself," it added.

Other music artwork covered by Dezeen includes Peter Saville's stripy design for pop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and Barnbrook's subversive design for The Next Day album by David Bowie, who died earlier this week.</p>
